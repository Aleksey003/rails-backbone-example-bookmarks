rails-backbone-example-bookmarks
================================
This is a basic single page app built using Ruby on Rails and Backbone.js. You can store bookmarks with tags and filter them to view the results. I have tried to keep the implementation as simple as possible and focussed majorly on using backbone to generate the content of the app. You can visit the app at http://thawing-dusk-3700.herokuapp.com/
